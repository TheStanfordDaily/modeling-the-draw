What does Modeling the Draw use for its calculations?

Modeling the Draw uses historical cutoff numbers from previous Draws, as reported by 
Stanford R&DE. For the purposes of the calculator, only the historical draw statistics 
from years 2014-2018 are considered. Many academic themed, Greek, and all-frosh residences 
are excluded from this dataset, and cannot be inputted into the calculator for an accurate 
reading.


How does MTD calculate my chances?

Modeling the Draw uses linear regression on historical cut-off numbers in order to 
estimate the cut-off numbers of Stanford residences for the 2019 Draw. Our calculator
considers several factors in its calculation, including sex, desired residence, desired 
type of room, the number of people you're drawing with, and your tier number.

In the case of split groups – where some but not all students with a certain cut-off number 
can make it into a certain residence – the calculator assumes that you will be able to 
make the cut-off. Additionally, sophomore priority for residences such as Toyon and FroSoCo
are not considered by the calculator.


What inputs does the calculator take, and what do they mean?

The first input, sex, will allow the calculator to consider either the men’s or women’s 
historical cut-off numbers.

The second input, room type, is the type of room that you’d like to draw into. The calculator
recognizes inputs in the format of “1 room single,” “2 room double,” and “1 room triple.” 
Please note that your residence might not have your desired room type; inputting an invalid 
room type for a residence will not lead to an accurate calculation. Additionally, 
for apartment complexes such as Mirrielees, request either a “2 bedroom apartment,” 
“3 bedroom apartment,” “4 bedroom apartment,” or “substance free housing.” Similarly, 
you should request either a “4-person” or “6-person” suite for GovCo’s Suites, and either 
a “standard room” or “premier room” for Row residences. Lastly, if you have no preference 
for your room type, input “Any.”

The third input, residence, is the residence that you’re considering drawing into. 
You could input a particular residence (e.g. “Branner”), a residence hall (e.g. 
“Gerhard Casper”), a part of campus (e.g. “West Campus”), or any dorm at Stanford (“Dorm”).

The fourth input, tier number, is the tier level that you are selecting.

The last input, apply type, is the number of people drawing with you as a group. Since 
our calculator only calculates your chances for the 2019 Draw, groups of 5 or greater 
or not recognized.


What does my outputted percentage mean?

The percentage that the Modeling the Draw calculator outputs is our estimate of your 
chances of drawing into the residence and room type that you’re applying for, based on 
historical draw data from previous years. If you receive the output “>99%,” it’s likely 
that your tier level is lower than our estimated cutoff number for your residence. 
If you receive the output “<0.1%,” it’s likely that your tier level is higher than 
our estimated cutoff number for your residence.
